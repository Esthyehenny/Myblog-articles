"Debugging is like being a detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer." 🔍💻🕵️‍♀️

As techies, we know the frustration of trying to find the root cause of a pesky bug. But let's face it, we've all been there at some point. And while it can be a daunting task, it's also an opportunity to hone our problem-solving skills and flex our detective muscles.

So the next time you're deep in the trenches of debugging, remember that you're not just trying to solve a problem, you're also uncovering clues and piecing together the evidence to solve the case. Happy sleuthing! 😎
